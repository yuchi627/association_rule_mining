# Implement a association rule mining algorithm

Given a input DB, mine strong association rules from the input DB with user-defined min_supp and min_conf

## The input DB format is following
* Each line is a transaction
* Each number is a item 
* There are many items in a transaction
> Example transaction: 39 73 74 75 76 77 78 79 

## Output the strong association rules 
> Example strong association rule: Rule {48} -> {39} Confidence (29142 / 42135)
